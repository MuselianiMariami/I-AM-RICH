ðŸ’° I Am Rich and My First App in Swift

Remember the iPhone app in 2008 that cost a jaw-dropping $999.99 but did absolutely nothing? That's "I Am Rich" for you! Created as a prank, it sold a mere eight copies before Apple pulled the plug.
The developer then released a "Lite" version for a "bargain" $9.99. And guess what? Android and Windows users wanted in on the fun too.

ðŸ“± The Original "I Am Rich" (first img): A glowing gem, a hefty price tag of $999.99, and absolutely no functionality whatsoever. Yet, it captured the attention of the world, selling a grand total of eight copies before disappearing from the App Store faster than you can say "refund, please!"

ðŸš€ My First Swift App(second img): Taking inspiration from the absurdity of "I Am Rich," I followed Dr. Angela Yu's video lecture and displayed this version â€“ an app complete with a glowing diamond! ðŸ’Ž
